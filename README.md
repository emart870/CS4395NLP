### What the program does
The program reads a csv file which contains data about people such as their name and phone number. It first formats the data to make it fit certain formats and then saves all that data into Person objects which gets printed out later
### How it runs
The program is written in Python, importing pathlib, sys, re, and pickle. Before using the program, the user need to make sure to set their sysreg to be the file path for their data file. To check the format of ID and Phone Number, the program uses regex
### Pros and Cons of Python text processing
The strengths of python text processing include the fact that python has many built-in functions for string manipulations and for file I/O. As for weaknesses, regex is still somewhat unintuitive, even in Python. Furthermore, at least in the PyCharm IDE I am using, the autocompletion made certain regex annoying to type out
### Learning and Review
This was the first time I've ever heard of pickle files so it was cool to learn about them. I've also never done much regex in Python before so that was also a learning experience. As for review, making and working with Objects and with file I/O were all concepts I've learned and worked on before

## Portfolio Assignment 2:  Exploring NLTK

## Portfolio Assignment 3: Word Guess Game
You can see assignment 3 code [here](Homework3_axg180112.py)
### What the program does
The program reads in a file, tokenizes it, lemmantizes each token, part-of-speech tags each lemma, collects all the lemmas that were tagged as nouns, counts how often each noun appears, collects the top 50 most common nouns, and plays a word-guessing game with the user using the list of top 50 common nouns
